# KYC Verification (Blockchain)
[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-truffle.svg)](https://forthebadge.com) \
**Description** \
Decentralized KYC verification process for banks that stores customer data in a blockchain. A distributed ledger is set up among all the banks, where one bank can upload the KYC of a customer and others can vote on the legitimacy of the customerâ€™s details. The KYC for the customers will be stored immutably on the blockchain and will be accessible to all the banks in the blockchain. \
***The smart contracts are written in Solidity programming language and deployed on a private ethereum network using Truffle.*** 

-----
***Install Dependencies (Commands for macOS; Make sure to have latest versions of Homebrew and Node/npm):*** 

>**Geth (go-ethereum)** \
*$ brew tap ethereum/ethereum* \
*$ brew install ethereum*

>**Truffle** \
*$ sudo npm install -g truffle*

>**Solidity** \
*$ sudo npm install -g solc*

-----
***Steps to set up a private ethereum network:***
>**Step 1**   \
*$ geth --datadir EthNetwork init genesis.json* (Inside the EthNetwork Folder which contains genesis.json) 

>**Step 2**   \
*$ geth --port 3000 --networkid 2023 --nodiscover --datadir=./EthNetwork --maxpeers=0  --rpc --rpcport 8545*

Network with an id of 2023 will start after execution of the above commands.

-----
***Create an account for each bank and start the mining process:***
>**For example, take HDFC Bank** \
*personal.newAccount("HDFC")* \
*personal.unlockAccount(web3.eth.coinbase, "HDFC", 15000)*

**To start the mining process,**
> *miner.start()*

**To stop the mining process,** 
> *miner.stop()*
-----
***Compile the smart contract in Truffle and deploy it to the private blockchain created:*** \
*Inside the Truffle folder which contains the contracts and migrations, run the following commands* 
>*$ truffle compile* \
*$ truffle migrate*
